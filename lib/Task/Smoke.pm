=head1 NAME

Task::Smoke - Install modules required for Pugs-like smoke system

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.18';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  cpan Task::Smoke

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Perl6::Pugs> is an experimental implementation of Perl 6. It does
not have many prerequisites by itself: merely perl 5.6.1 or 5.8.3,
and a decently new ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

If you wish to run the powerful smoke test system that comes with Pugs,
however, you'll need these modules. Once installed, you can run a smoke
test and generate a colorful smoke.html by running the following command
in the Pugs build directory:

  make smoke

You are encouraged to submit your results to the public smokeserver,
especially if you run on an uncommon platform:

  make upload-smoke

Existing smoke reports can be viewed at L<http://smoke.pugscode.org>.

=head2 Non-Pugs usage

You are invited to use this system in your Perl 5 projects, though
currently this may require some tweaking. Please see the talk
L<http://perlcabal.org/~gaal/pugstest/start.html>, "Reusing the Pugs
Smoke System", for this end.

=head2 Note on YAML providers

This bundle installs either YAML::Syck or YAML.pm, depending on your
environment. YAML::Syck is faster, but requires c build capabilities.
