Task-Smoke

L<Perl6::Pugs> is an experimental implementation of Perl 6. It does
not have many prerequisites by itself: merely perl 5.6.1 or 5.8.3,
and a decently new ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

If you wish to run the powerful smoke test system that comes with
pugs, however, you'll need these modules. Once installed, you can
run a smoke test and generate a colorful smoke.html by running
the following command in the pugs build directory:

  make smoke

You are encouraged to submit your results to the public smokeserver,
especially if you run on an uncommon platform:

  perl util/smokeserv/smoke-client.pl smoke.html


Non-Pugs usage:

You are invited to use this system in your Perl 5 projects,
though currently this may require some tweaking. Plase see the talk
L<http://perlcabal.org/~gaal/pugstest/start.html>, "Reusing the Pugs
Smoke System", for this end.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
