Revision history for Task-Smoke

0.16    2007-04-22
        Require YAML::Syck 0.85 when 

0.15    2007-01-30
        Require Test::TAP::Model 0.08 or higher, which works with the
        new incompatible API of Test::Harness 2.64. Since the incompatibility
        is bidirectional, this eventually also requires that version of
        Test::Harness.

0.14    2006-09-21
        Fix order of requires() and auto_install() to actually do
        something. Reported by rodi++ and fixed by audreyt++.

0.13    2006-07-09
        Include inc/ in distribution (closes
        http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20372)

0.10    2006-07-05
